# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## Project overview 

Telecommunication cooperation provides a dataset for its customers, offering a wide range of services, including phone lines, internet types, contract types, and internet connections.
The goal is to analyze and predict customer behavior, identify factors contributing to customer churn, and provide recommendations to improve retention.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas: 

  - Churn Behavior Analysis: Evaluation of churn patterns based on contract type, payment method, internet service, and additional features such as online security and device protection.

  - Customer Segmentation: Identification of key customer segments more likely to churn.
    
  - Service Usage Impact: Analysis of how services like streaming, online backup, and unlimited data influence customer loyalty and churn rate.
  
  - Demographic Trends: Analysis of customer churn based on demographic factors, including age, marital status, and state.

  - Recommendations: Strategic suggestions are provided to improve customer retention.
